        <p class="p1">Welcome to my portfolio page! My name is Matthew Neuber. I am a business intelligence manager by day, but I am also
            a Philadelphia sports fan, traveler, photographer, proud uncle, and maybe most importantly... an aspiring web
            developer! I am intersted in learning more about technology and how it is utilzed in businesses and startups.
            I am always looking to continue my education, and I am currently enrolled in UPenn's Coding Bootcamp in order
            to learn full stack web development and computer science.
        </p>

        <p>I've created this profile and portfolio page in order to keep track of all of the interesting projects, web apps
            and programs that I am building. Visit my portfolio page for a tour of them. Also visit the contact page to reach out for
            more information.</p>

        <p class="p-last">Please check back periodically for updates to this website.  I'll be posting more as I continue my journey over the next 6 months.</p>
